## Advent-of-Code

[This repository](https://github.com/DjordjeNedovic/Advent-of-Code) contains my solutions for [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/), a yearly programming challenge that sharpens problem-solving skills with fun and intricate puzzles. While my solutions may not always be the most optimized or fastest, they reflect my thought process, approach to problem-solving, and continuous learning journey. 😊

### What's Inside?
Each folder corresponds to a specific day and includes:
- Code to solve the given task (main file is always `Program.cs`).
- Feel free to use my code as inspiration or for testing your solutions!

### Technical Details
All solutions are implemented in **.NET Core 3.0**, leveraging C# to tackle the diverse and often challenging tasks.
