I developed a responsive mini blog and portfolio website using Node.js and Tailwind CSS to showcase my work and share
insights. This project was driven by my desire to deepen my understanding of back-end development and modern web design
principles, while also enhancing my technical versatility as I aim to transition into a consultant role within a tech agency.

Building this platform allowed me to explore Node.js for dynamic content generation and Tailwind CSS for rapid, elegant
UI development. It reflects my commitment to continuous learning and my passion for creating impactful, user-centered solutions.
My ultimate goal is to leverage these skills in a consultancy capacity, helping clients craft innovative, scalable web
applications that meet their unique needs.
