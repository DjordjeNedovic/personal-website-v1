In this post, we will walk through the steps to set up an Azure DevOps pipeline that enables packaging and publishing
preview versions of NuGet packages. This process includes defining the package version, packing the project,
and publishing it to the desired NuGet feed.

## 1. Defining the Package Version

First, we need to define the package version that will be used during the packaging process. For preview versions of the
package, we use the Azure DevOps Build Number as the base version. If the current branch is not master, we append the
`beta` label and the current date, which helps to clearly identify preview versions.

```yaml
variables:
pkgVer: ''

stages:
  - stage: build
    jobs:
      - pwsh: |
        $pv = '$(Build.BuildNumber)'
        if("$(Build.SourceBranch)" -ne "refs/heads/master")
        {
        $pv = @($pv, "beta", (Get-Date -Format "yyyyMMdd")) -Join "-"
        }
        Write-Host "##vso[task.setvariable variable=pkgVer;]$pv"
        Write-Host "Package Version = ${pv}"
    displayName: Set Package version
```
The package version is then set as a variable, which will be used in the subsequent steps.

## 2. Packing the Project

Once the package version is defined, the next step is to package the `.csproj` file into a NuGet package. This is done
using the `DotNetCoreCLI` task. We package the project with the `--no-build` option since we assume the project is already
built, and we set the package version using the previously defined `$(pkgVer)` variable.

```yaml
  - task: DotNetCoreCLI@2
    displayName: Pack Projects
    inputs:
      command: custom
      custom: pack
      projects: '<PATH_TO_PROJECT>/<PROJECT_NAME>.csproj'  # replace with your project path
      arguments: '--no-build -c Release /p:PackageVersion=$(pkgVer) -o $(Build.ArtifactStagingDirectory)/nupkgs'
```
The package is placed in the directory `$(Build.ArtifactStagingDirectory)/nupkgs`, which will be used for the publishing step.

## 3. Publishing the Package to a NuGet Feed

Once the project is packaged, the next step is publishing the package to the NuGet feed. This is achieved using the
`DotNetCoreCLI` task with the `push` command. The package that we previously generated is pushed to the desired feed.
```yaml
  - task: DotNetCoreCLI@2
    displayName: Publish to nuget Feed
    inputs:
      command: push
      packagesToPush: '$(Build.ArtifactStagingDirectory)/nupkgs/*.nupkg'
      feedPublish: '<PUBLISH_FEED_NAME>'  # replace with your feed name
```
Here, you need to replace `<PUBLISH_FEED_NAME>` with the name of your NuGet feed where you want to publish the package.
This could be your private feed on Azure Artifacts or any other feed of your choice.

## 4. Publishing the NuGet Package as an Artifact in the Pipeline

As an additional step, you can publish the generated NuGet package as an artifact within the pipeline. This is useful
if you want to store the packages for further use or sharing between teams.

```yaml
  - publish: $(Build.ArtifactStagingDirectory)/nupkgs/
    displayName: Publish Nuget packages as pipeline artefact
    artifact: nupkgs
```

## 5. Complete YAML Example

```yaml
variables:
  pkgVer: ''

stages:
  - stage: build
    jobs:
      - pwsh: |
        $pv = '$(Build.BuildNumber)'
        if("$(Build.SourceBranch)" -ne "refs/heads/master")
        {
          $pv = @($pv, "beta", (Get-Date -Format "yyyyMMdd")) -Join "-"
        }

        Write-Host "##vso[task.setvariable variable=pkgVer;]$pv"
        Write-Host "Package Version = ${pv}"
      displayName: Set Package version
      
      - task: DotNetCoreCLI@2
        displayName: Pack Projects
        inputs:
          command: custom
          custom: pack
          projects: <PATH_TO_PROJECT>/<PROJECT_NAME>.csproj
          arguments: '--no-build -c Release /p:PackageVersion=$(pkgVer) -o $(Build.ArtifactStagingDirectory)/nupkgs'

      - task: DotNetCoreCLI@2
        displayName: Publish to nuget Feed
        inputs:
          command: push
          packagesToPush: '$(Build.ArtifactStagingDirectory)/nupkgs/*.nupkg'
          feedPublish: <PUBLISH_FEED_NAME>

      - publish: $(Build.ArtifactStagingDirectory)/nupkgs/
        displayName: Publish Nuget packages as pipeline artefact
        artefact: nupks
```
