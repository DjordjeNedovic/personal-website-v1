Task was simple "Update terraform to the latest version". Only issue was that particular solution version 0.12v. And if
you know anything about terraform update, then you need to do it in following order:

```
0.12v -> 0.13v -> 0.14v -> latest version
```

Pritty simple, so in `provider.tf` I did following:

```
terraform {
    required_version = ">= 0.12" # to "~> 0.13"
}

```

And happyily push it on the branch, run release pipeline and see large error in `terraform apply` step:


```
Error: Provider produces incosistent result after apply

When appliying chagens to azurerm_servicebus_subscription_rule.example,
provider "registry.terraform.io/hashicorp/azurerm" produced an unexpected new
value: Root resource was present, but not absent.

This is a bug in the provider, which should be reported in the provider's own
issue tracker.

```

Quick glance on the resource itself does not raise any alarm:
```
resource "azurerm_servicebus_subscription_rule" "example" {
  name            = "$Default"
  subscription_id = azurerm_servicebus_subscription.example.id
  filter_type     = "SqlFilter"
  sql_filter      = "colour = 'red'"
}
```

Google does not help either. ChatGPT even less. So, I decided to play with it, and to see what caused this.
First thing that I changed was the name. From the `$Default` to the `TestNameSubscription` and on my dismay `terraform
apply` passed. Somehow, *undocumented* `$` sign can cause apply step to fail.

Before:
```
resource "azurerm_servicebus_subscription_rule" "example" {
  name            = "$Default"
  subscription_id = azurerm_servicebus_subscription.example.id
  filter_type     = "SqlFilter"
  sql_filter      = "colour = 'red'"
}
```

After:
```
resource "azurerm_servicebus_subscription_rule" "example" {
  name            = "tfex_servicebus_rule"
  subscription_id = azurerm_servicebus_subscription.example.id
  filter_type     = "SqlFilter"
  sql_filter      = "colour = 'red'"
}
```
