description: >-
    Addressing an issue with the AzureRM provider caused by using the $ character in resource names

This document outlines the process of updating Terraform from version 0.12 to the latest version, including an issue
encountered during the terraform apply step. The issue, related to using the $ character in a resource name, caused
an unexpected error with the AzureRM provider. The investigation and solution, which involved modifying the resource
name, are discussed in detail below.

# Story time

The task was simple: "Update Terraform to the latest version." The challenge arose because the current solution was
using Terraform version `0.12`, and as you may know, updating Terraform requires upgrading through a series of steps:

```
0.12v -> 0.13v -> 0.14v -> latest version
```

This process is straightforward, so in `provider.tf`, I updated the version constraint:

```
terraform {
    required_version = ">= 0.12" # to "~> 0.13"
}

```
After pushing the changes to the branch and running the release pipeline, I encountered an error
during the `terraform apply` step:

```
Error: Provider produces incosistent result after apply

When appliying chagens to azurerm_servicebus_subscription_rule.example,
provider "registry.terraform.io/hashicorp/azurerm" produced an unexpected new
value: Root resource was present, but not absent.

This is a bug in the provider, which should be reported in the provider's own
issue tracker.

```

A quick glance at the resource didn’t raise any alarms:
```
resource "azurerm_servicebus_subscription_rule" "example" {
  name            = "$Default"
  subscription_id = azurerm_servicebus_subscription.example.id
  filter_type     = "SqlFilter"
  sql_filter      = "colour = 'red'"
}
```

Searching for a solution didn’t yield any helpful results, not even from ChatGPT. So, I decided to experiment with the
configuration to see if I could identify the root cause. First thing that I changed was the name. From the `$Default` to
the `TestNameSubscription` and on my dismay `terraform apply` passed. It appears that the `$` sign in the resource name
was causing the issue, although this behavior is **undocumented** and not mentioned in Terraform’s official documentation.

# Solution

Before:
```
resource "azurerm_servicebus_subscription_rule" "example" {
  name            = "$Default"
  subscription_id = azurerm_servicebus_subscription.example.id
  filter_type     = "SqlFilter"
  sql_filter      = "colour = 'red'"
}
```

After:
```
resource "azurerm_servicebus_subscription_rule" "example" {
  name            = "tfex_servicebus_rule"
  subscription_id = azurerm_servicebus_subscription.example.id
  filter_type     = "SqlFilter"
  sql_filter      = "colour = 'red'"
}
```
